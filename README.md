## Features and Technologies in your Swift Playground
My Swift playground, called Around the Solar System in 3 minutes, is a playground teaching the user all about space. There are 3 levels to the playground - Level 1 - the learning level, Level 2 - the quiz level, and Level 3 - the explore level. In Level 1, I used ARKit to make the view that shows the user each planet in our Solar System, which can be clicked on to learn about. After the user learns about at least one planet, I show the 'Next' button and store the names of the planets that the User clicks on in UserDefaults. In Level 2 - the quiz level, I use SwiftUI and the core basics of Swift to procure the questions based on the planets that the user clicked on. In Level 3 - The Explore Level, I used SwiftUI, UIKit and ARKit to make a similar view to Level 1, except with a custom planet that the user designs.

In my Swift playground, I used SwiftUI to construct many of the views for the user, because it is easy to use, it is a new technology and suited my needs to have a responsive UI. I also used ARKit and SceneKit to make the Planetary view, which shows the user all of the planets in our Solar System, in their current location. I used ARKit and SceneKit because they gave the playground more interaction and was easier to show the scale of all of the planets. Additionally, I used UIKit to make the AR View, because UIKit is easier to use when conforming to other protocols.
